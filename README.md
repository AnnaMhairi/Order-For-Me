# Order For Me
Order For Me was the cumulative effort of myself, Jackee Hernandez-Torres, Michael Perez, and Mikhail Delos Trinos. Our project was a simple yet effective Rails web application that allowed users to enter a restaurant and returned to them the top five most-mentioned dishes at that restaurant by using the Yelp and Foursquare APIs, along with scraping Foursquare with Nokogiri. All team members had a full-stack experience, implementing technologies such as Ruby, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, CSS, and HTML.
